## 🛠️ **Task Breakdown**  

### 1️⃣ **Set Up the Virtual Piano**  
- Use **HTML and CSS** to create the **piano layout**.  
- Ensure the keys are **properly styled and positioned**.  
- Each key should have a **unique identifier** corresponding to a **musical note**.  

### 2️⃣ **Implement Sound Playback**  
- Each key should **play the correct sound** when clicked.  
- Ensure that each key corresponds to a specific **.mp3 file** in the `/sounds/` folder.  
- Use the `<audio>` element or **JavaScript** to trigger sound playback.  

### 3️⃣ **Enable Keyboard Input**  
- Implement **keyboard support**, so notes can be played using specific keys (e.g., `"A"`, `"S"`, `"D"`).  
- Ensure that **pressing the correct key** plays the expected note.  
- Verify that **both mouse clicks and keyboard presses** produce the correct sounds.
